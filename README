gridguess - classroom board game
================================
gridguess is a classroom board game designed to be both fun and easy to prepare
for educators with any level of technical skill. It functions on a grid of
unknown questions displayed in columns with point values. Each slot is defined
by a formatted plaintext file.

Requirements
------------
In order to build gg, you need the SFML header files and the CSFML bindings.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup.
Edit gg.c to configure the path to a font.

Afterwards, enter the following command to build and install gridguess (if
necessary, as root):

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of ccash_cmd is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure, and simple.
